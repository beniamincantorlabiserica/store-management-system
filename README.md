## Project
### Main idea
The project consists of two java applications for internal sales and inventory management.
One of them will be the client (an app used by the cashier and the store manager) and the
other will be the server, a console application meant to communicate with and store data in a database
about the inventory and sales.

> Our main actors that interact with the app will be *the cashier* and *the store manager*.
